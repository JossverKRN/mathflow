Flow Mathematics: A Tribute to Clear Thinking
Bridging thought and mathematical structure through automation.

Vision
This project was born from a simple idea:
Mathematical thinking should flow naturally, without friction.

Inspired by Donald Knuth’s vision of TeX — where clarity of thought meets clarity of expression —
this method builds rapid LaTeX macro systems to allow deeper focus on the structure and behavior of mathematics, not the mechanics of typing.

About
Pure LaTeX macro toolkit using AutoHotKey

Designed to train the mind in mathematical structure

Helps in learning limits, derivatives, control theory, Laplace transforms, and more

Honors the ideals of deep, clear, thoughtful craftsmanship

Tribute
This project is dedicated to Donald Knuth, whose life's work continues to light the path for those seeking clarity, beauty, and discipline in thought.
