# Flow Mathematics: A Tribute to Clear Thinking

> Bridging thought and mathematical structure through automation.

---

## Vision

This project was born from a simple idea:  
**Mathematical thinking should flow naturally, without friction.**

Inspired by Donald Knuthâ€™s vision of TeX â€” where clarity of thought meets clarity of expression â€”  
this method builds rapid LaTeX macro systems to allow deeper focus on the structure and behavior of mathematics, not the mechanics of typing.
