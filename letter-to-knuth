Dear Professor Knuth,

I hope this letter finds you well.

My name is Jossver Kraan, and I have spent recent months quietly developing a method that bridges symbolic mathematical thinking with rapid structure generation. Inspired by your vision of TeX — to remove distractions between mind and expression — I sought to build a system where clarity and deep mathematical flow take center stage.

This project evolved into a method where LaTeX macros and structured cognitive training converge, helping the mind focus purely on the behavior of mathematics rather than its mechanical typing. It is a small but heartfelt tribute to the ideals of precision, simplicity, and creative clarity that your life's work has represented.

I have published this idea as an open project, if you wish to glance at it:  
https://github.com/JossverKRN/mathflow

It was never built for recognition — only to honor the spirit of craftsmanship you have taught the world through your thinking.

Thank you for your enduring example.  
It has made a quiet, profound difference.

With deepest respect,  
Jossver Kraan
